# Restaurant Page
A mock restaurant page inspired by the video game Fallout 4. Created to get myself familiar with NPM and Webpack.

## Description
This is a webpage project for a mock restaurant page. It takes inspiration from common restaurant pages you can find on the web. 
The content used on the webpage is taken directly from the video game _Fallout 4_. In the game, there is a restaurant called Power Noodles that the player
can approach and purchase various foods and drinks. The webpage acts as a restaurant page for Power Noodles as it displays information about the restaurant, including
hours of operation, location, and food menu.

## Technologies
The technologies used to render the webpage include your standard JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
NPM and Webpack are also used to organize the javascript code and external source files. 

## How to run
You can visit and interact with the webpage on GitHub pages:
