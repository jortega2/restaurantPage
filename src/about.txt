"Noodles. We all eat them. We all love them. And Diamond City's Power Noodles has supplied this sustenance for the past fifteen years. From the stilted mechanical cadence of Takahashi's programmed Japanese, to the fragrant steam that wafts from each bowl, to the scalding tang of each delicious mouthful - the ordering and eating of noodles is but one of many shared human experiences. Or is it?" 
-The Synthetic Truth

This structure directly opposite the city's main entrance in the center of the market is a small outdoor restaurant. Counters encircle a central pillar, with Takahashi behind one of them. A cooking station sits nearby. The pillar features a functional power reactor, supplying the surrounding buildings with electricity.

Approximately 43 years before Power Noodles was established, a bar that occupied the same space in the market was the scene of the Broken Mask incident. This violent event resulted in the death of ten individuals at the hand of a malfunctioning Institute synth in May 2229.

Upon meeting Takahashi for the first time and hearing his signature question ("Nan-ni shimasko-ka?"), a nearby resident will say "Just say yes, it's all he understands."

Companions will try to talk to Takahashi when arriving in the Diamond City market for the first time.

MacCready enjoys Takahashi's noodles immensely. If he is the Sole Survivor's current companion, he accepts a bowl from the robotic chef, and when finished, enthusiastically asks for more.

If visiting Diamond City on Halloween, Power Noodles is decorated with red skull cutouts on the counter and "Happy Halloween" banners stretched across the canopy.

If visiting Diamond City on Christmas, Power Noodles is decorated with Christmas trees and lights connected to surrounding buildings.

The Far Harbor note Taste test found in the Nucleus makes a reference to Power Noodles.
